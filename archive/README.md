# Archive
## Overview
Due to the age of these files, I didn't see it fit to include them on the portfolio proper, at least for now. However, I still see them as potential candidates to offer up on a subdomain in the future (in the case of archive/webtoys, in which case I will likely rebuild, expand and/or create new webtoys) or showcasing them with appropriate explanation (in the case of archive/robots).

## Webtoys
These are simple webtoys I had created on the old site, dating back to 2019, without any updates since. I like them conceptually and would like to look into recreating and expanding on them in future. Additionally, it is not out of the question that I'd be open to creating new webtoys.

## Robots
During my work experience in the summer of 2019, I was challenged to create a robot to participate in a battle against other robots. As part of this challenge, I created 4 robots, each using different strategies in the fight. In particular, **AshBot.cs** showcases a integer underflow vulnerability in the original RobotWars source and exploits it to great effect.
