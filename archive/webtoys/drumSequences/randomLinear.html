    //This entire section went through many different revisions, as I decided to change the language I was programming in for the last quarter of development. I spent most of my time creating the font and making it match my source material accurately and making it suitable for reading. I initially developed the program in Python, which may have influenced some of my approaches here. I did most of my debugging and testing within Python, before I realised that it would be easier to rewrite to JavaScript, which gave better device compatiblity with it. Saying that, the rewrite only took about 10-20 minutes.

    var grooves = [["bcad",2],["bead",2],["bcae",2],["beac",2],["bdae",2],["bdac",2],["bcadae",3],["bcaead",3],["beadac",3],["beacad",3],["bdacae",3],["bdaeac",3],["bcadacac",4],["bcadacae",4],["bcadaeae",4],["bcacadae",4],["bcacaead",4],["bcaeacac",4],["bcaeacad",4],["bcadadae",4],["beacadae",4],["beadacad",4],["bdacaead",4],["bdaeacad",4],["bdaeadac",4]];             //Here, because the sequences I was given had different lengths attached to them, I decided to use 2D arrays, with one sub-entry being the sequence itself and the other being the number of beats contained within that. This meant that I could construct a 16-beat bar consistently. The font uses characters a-e, hence the jumble of letters here.

    function generateRandom() {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * (grooves.length - 1));        //I use floor to round the 'index number' to something suitable for arrays. Floor in particular was used to ensure that the number it rounds to always stays within the bounds of the array.

        while (noteCount != 16) {
            if (noteCount + grooves[randomNumber][1] <= 16) {           //Firstly, it needs to check if the number assigned to the sequence will push the note
                noteCount += grooves[randomNumber][1];                  //Count over 16. If it doesn't, then add it in. Otherwise,
                finalString += grooves[randomNumber][0];

                failedAttempts += 1;                                    //And increment failedAttempts by one.
            }

            if (failedAttempts > 20) {          //As mentioned earlier, failed attempts were common in my testing. I found that if a sequence had been generated that didn't have a note count that totalled up to 16, the whole system would lock up completely.
                noteCount = 0;
                randomNumber = generateRandom();        //In the case of the number of failed attempts going over 20, I erase the line that was causing the issue, reset all necessary values and try again.

This is more reliable than using some form of CSS formatting as that could become dependent on screen width, which would make it difficult in practice to read.
        noteCount = 0;
        randomNumber = generateRandom();            //These variables are just resetting values if needed for the next cycle round
