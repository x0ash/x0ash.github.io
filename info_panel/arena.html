<h1>Arena</h1>
</br><h2>Overview</h2>
<p><i>Arena (working-title)</i> is a <b>first-person arena shooter</b> I am working on as a hobby project. Inspired by games such as <i>Quake III Arena (1999)</i>, <i>Unreal Tournament (1999)</i>, and <i>Half-Life (1998)</i>, it features fast-paced combat focused around <b>'bunnyhopping'</b> - a movement technique to gain additional speed.</p>
<p>Due to it being very early in development, the source code for Arena is currently unavailable publicly, though I have plans to open-source the project once finished.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Client made using <i>Unity</i>, a widely used game engine</li>
	<li>Custom server executable featuring <b>prediction</b> & <b>rollback</b></li>
	<li><b>Artificial intelligence</b> for non-player characters to simulate real opponents</li>
</ul>
