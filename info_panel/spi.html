<h1>Steam Player Investigator</h1>
</br><h2>Overview</h2>
<p><i>Steam Player Investigator</i> is a utility created using <b>.NET MAUI</b> that interacts with <i>Steam</i> to determine if a player is a <b>'smurf'</b> or not.</p>
<p>A <b>smurf</b> is a player who plays on a <b>lesser-used</b> account, sometimes created specifically for smurfing, in order to play against <b>lesser-skilled</b> players in multiplayer games. As opponents these days tend to be matched based on skill level over time, <b>competitive integrity</b> is lost when a player is found to be smurfing.</p>
<p>The Steam Player Investigator aims to conclude if a player is a smurf so users can accurately report offenders.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Cross-platform user interface using <b>.NET MAUI</b></li>
	<li>Interaction with the <b>Steam Web API</b></li>
	<li><b>Webpage scraping</b> & <b>parsing</b> for additional data</li>
	<li><b>XML parsing</b> for gathering additional data</li>
	<li><b>Binary-classification model</b> using account data as parameters</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional information</h2>
<p>Created as a project for my second-year university studies, Steam Player Investigator was created alongside a team of 5 fellow students. Throughout the six months of development we had on the project, we designed everything in the utility in consulation with each other, from the data we needed and how to obtain it to presenting the final decision to the user in the GUI.</p>
<p>The project was developed following a RAD pipeline with individual work coming from implementating our design work. Additionally, paired programming would be used when bridging the gap between two unique implementations.</p>
<h2>Source Code</h2>
<p>The source code is publicly available on GitHub, and forks from an experimental C# Steam Web API wrapper I had created early in the planning phase of the project. Full commit history is available.</p>
